My name is Marco Di Paola, software engineer by vocation, recently felt in love with Scala and Functional Programming.

I created this blog for three main reasons:

- As Einstein said, ”You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother”.
- I want to prove to myself that I can still start a new project and keep it alive for a while.
- My English sucks, writing a blog can be a way to improve.
