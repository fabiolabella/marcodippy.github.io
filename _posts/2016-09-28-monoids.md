  _Monoid_... I love the way this word sounds, so this definitely must be the
  topic for my new blog post.

Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,  for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers by talking about_ **Morphisms**, **Arrows**, **Categories** _and other_ **confusing things with funny names**_._

A lot of FP concepts bear a scary name like _Functor_ or _Monad_ coming from category theory (subject I know ___nothing___ about), but despite their names some of those concepts are fairly easy to grasp. One of the easiest is called **monoid**.

In few words, monoid are abstraction over things that can be _“aggregated/summed up”_ with an associative binary operation. That's all. 

More formally, a monoid is a **set of objects** plus an **operation** to combine those objects that must obey the following laws:

* *Closure Law*: the result of the _operation_ must be an element of the input set; given _(a, b) ∈ S_  and _operation(a, b) = x then x ∈ S_.
* Associative Law: (a _op_ b) _op_ c == a _op_ (b _op_ c).
* Identity Element: the _operation_ must have an element (also called _zero_) that "does nothing": zero _op_ a == a and a _op_ zero == a (these are called, respectively, _left identity_ and _right identity_

To make it event more crystal clear, here are some examples:

| Set      | Operation | Identity Elem.     | Monoid? | Why?                                                                                                 |
|----------|:---------:|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integers | +         | 0                  | Yes     | a + b = c => c is always an Integer <br /> (1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3) <br /> a + 0 = a and 0 + a = a  |
| Integers | *         | 1                  | Yes     |                                                                                                      |
| Integers | /         |                    | No      | 5 / 2 = 2.5 => not an Integer                                                                        |
| Integers | max       | Integers.MIN_VALUE | Yes     |                                                                                                      |
| Strings  | concat    | ""                 | Yes     | I'm sure you can figure it out                                                                       |
| List     | concat    | empty list         | Yes     | same as above                                                                                        |
| Boolean  | AND       | true               | Yes     | try it yourself           


Ok, at this point you should have understood what a monoid is, but you're probably wondering why these laws are so important (if you're not, you should!).

### Why the closure law ???
Suppose that you want to calculate the sum of a list of integers List(1,2,3,4) and suppose that we start by summing 1 and 2 (remember that our operation is binary): 1+2 = 3 => List(3,3,4). Again: 3+3 = 6 => List(6,4). Again! 6+4 = 10. Great, we applied our "sum" monoid to the entire list and we got our result. If at one of these steps the operation returned a Float instead of an Integer, our monoid would no longer be suitable for the task (our monoid knows how to sum _Integers_).
So, the benefit of ensuring the closure law is that we can make our binary operation working on arbitrarily long sets of elements (list, sequences or even trees!).

### Why an associative operation ???
Do you really want to operate on a list (for example) and be forced to define the order of every operation? who cares if we start from the first or the last element of the list? And, more important, how can you parallelize your operation if it must follow a specific order?
Using associative operations facilitate parallel computation by letting us free to _divide and conquer_ our algorithms.

### Why an identity element ???
What should you return if your list is empty? what can you do with a binary operation and a list with a single element? 
 

## Ok ok, I got it, but now I wanna see some code
Ok let's write some monoids!

```scala
trait Monoid[A] {
  def append(a1: A, a2: A): A
  def zero: A
}

val stringMonoid = new Monoid[String] {
  def append(a1: String, a2: String) = a1 + a2
  val zero = ""
}

val intMonoid = new Monoid[Int] {
  def append(a1: Int, a2: Int) = a1 + a2
  val zero = 0
}

List("I", "love", "scala").fold(stringMonoid.zero)(stringMonoid.append) // "Ilovescala"
List(1, 2, 3).fold(intMonoid.zero)(intMonoid.append) // 6
```

(Beware that just creating a trait named `Monoid` doesn't mean that scala enforces the _"Monoid laws"_ for you, so remember to *test* that `append` is really associative and respect the closure law)

I guess you don't need further explaination to understand this basic example. 
As we know, monoids allow us to abstract over the types we're "reducing", so I'm legitimate to create a generic function like this that works for every type `A` for which a `Monoid[A]` is defined:

```scala
def sum[A] (l: List[A])(m: Monoid[A]) = l.fold(m.zero)(m.append)
```

Cool, now we can use our `sum` function for `List[String]` and `List[Int]`:

```scala
sum(List("I", "love", "scala"))(stringMonoid) // "Ilovescala"
sum(List(1,2,3))(intMonoid) // 6
```

There's a trick we can use to avoid passing everytime the monoid instance to the sum function, this trick is called `implicit parameter`:

```scala
implicit val stringMonoid = new Monoid[String] { ... }
implicit val intMonoid = new Monoid[Int] { ... }

def sum[A] (l: List[A])(implicit m: Monoid[A]) = l.fold(m.zero)(m.append)

sum(List("I", "love", "scala")) // "Ilovescala"
sum(List(1,2,3)) // 6
```

Nice, now our code looks cleaner... but you still have to discover the real power of monoids.

# Monoids compose!
Yes, you heard it right! If you have two monoids you can compose them and get a new monoid (this is called _product_).
Let's write a function to compose two monoids:

```scala
def composeMonoids[A, B](ma: Monoid[A], mb: Monoid[B]) = new Monoid[(A, B)] {
  def append(x: (A, B), y: (A, B)): (A, B) =
    (x, y) match {
      case ((a1, b1), (a2, b2)) => (ma.append(a1, a2), mb.append(b1, b2))
    }

  def zero: (A, B) = (ma.zero, mb.zero)
}
```

Wow, that was easy!
Now if we have to "sum" the list

```scala
val listOfTuples: List[(Int, String)] = List((1, "I"), (2, "love"), (3, "scala"))
```

we can reuse the monoids we already wrote for `Int` and `String`

```scala
implicit val newComposedMonoid: Monoid[(Int, String)] = monoidProd(intMonoid, stringMonoid);

sum(listOfTuples) // (6, "Ilovescala")
```
